# Temperature Display with RTC and OLED

This project uses an Arduino to read temperature values, display time and temperature on an OLED screen, and control an LED based on the temperature. It utilizes an RTC (Real-Time Clock) to keep track of the time and display it on the OLED screen.

## Features
- **Displays Time**: Shows the current time using the RTC DS3231 module.
- **Displays Temperature**: Reads temperature from an analog sensor and displays it on the OLED.
- **Temperature-Controlled LED**: An LED connected to `lamPin` is activated if the temperature exceeds a threshold (28°C by default).
- **Button-Controlled LED Off**: Pressing the button connected to `buttonPin` will turn off the LED.

## Components Used
- **RTC DS3231** for accurate timekeeping.
- **OLED Display (SSD1306, 128x64)** for showing time and temperature.
- **Temperature Sensor** (connected to analog pin `A0`).
- **Button** (connected to digital pin `0`) for LED control.
- **LED** (connected to digital pin `13`).

## Libraries Required
- **RTClib** for managing the DS3231 RTC.
- **Wire** for I2C communication.
- **U8glib** for OLED display control.

## Wiring
- **Temperature Sensor** connected to analog pin `A0`.
- **Button** connected to digital pin `0`.
- **LED** connected to digital pin `13`.
- **OLED Display** connected via I2C (pins depend on the Arduino model).

## Code Explanation

### Initialization
1. **Include Libraries**: Required libraries are included for managing the RTC, I2C communication, and OLED display.
2. **Setup Function**:
   - Initializes Serial, RTC, and OLED display.
   - Sets up the LED and button pins.

### Main Loop
- **Temperature Display**: Displays temperature and time on the OLED.
- **LED Control**:
  - Turns on the LED if the temperature exceeds 28°C.
  - Turns off the LED if the button is pressed.

### Functions
- **`getTime()`**: Returns the current time from the RTC as a string.
- **`getTemp()`**: Calculates temperature based on the analog input.
- **`oledWrite()`**: Writes time and temperature to specific coordinates on the OLED.

## Usage
1. **Upload** the code to your Arduino.
2. **Connect** the components as per the wiring.
3. **Observe** the OLED screen for time and temperature readings.
4. **Control** the LED using temperature and the button.
